# Homework 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

This app is a simple calendar application that allows the user to save events for each hour of the day. This app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

The current day is displayed at the top of the calendar. When the user scrolls down, they are presented with timeblocks Each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future. When the user clicks into a timeblock they can enter an event. When the user clicks the save button for that timeblock, the text for that event is saved in local storage. Saved events persist after page is refreshed.
